        overview:"we combat child malnutrition in rural Maya communities during children's early years with education, monitoring, and treatment. This saves lives and offers better futures for the children spared from malnutrition and stunting, which are linked with higher risks of chronic diseases and diminished success in school and work. Indigenous Maya in rural Guatemala confront a variety of barriers to accessing health care, which especially impact children. More than 80% of children these rural communities are chronically malnourished or stunted. The COVID pandemic and climate change have magnified these problems. This project supports our work partnering with families to treat and prevent stunting for children under 2.5 years of age in some of Guatemala's most vulnerable communities.",
